* All java statments appear within a class, and all methods are implemented within it.

* From java 8, an interface can have a default implmentation for a method.

* Classes and interfaces are the most important of the five fundamental reference 
types defined by Java. Arrays, enums, and annotations are the other three.

* public class Integer extends Number implements Serializable, Comparable { 
// class members go here

Declarations may also include abstract and final. A class cannot be both abstract and final.

FIELDS/METHODS
Instance fields/methods
Class fields/methods

final -> variable cannot be changed after initialization
Fields can have initializers.
privateinta=17,b=37,c=53;

Fields that are both static and final are compile-time constants that javac may inline. 

Transient: 
This modifier specifies that a field is not part of the persistent state of an object 
and that it need not be serialized along with the rest of the object.
volatile:

This modifier indicates that the field has extra semantics for concurrent use by two or 
more threads. The volatile modifier says that the value of a field must always be read 
from and flushed to main memory, and that it may not be cached by a thread (in a register 
or CPU cache). 

CLASS FIELDS
There is only 1 copy of it.
public static final double PI = 3.14159; //Class constant
A public static field is essentially a global variable. Since we use fully qualified names
there will not be any name collissions.

CLASS METHODS
A class method cannot use any instance fields or instance methods because class methods are 
not associated with an instance of the class. 

public static double radiansToDegrees(double rads) { 
	return rads * 180 / PI;
}

double d = Circle.radiansToDegrees(2.0);

CONSTRUCTOR CHAINING
// This is the basic constructor: initialize the radius
public Circle(double r) { this.r = r; }
// This constructor uses this() to invoke the constructor above 
public Circle() { this(1.0); }

Refactor common initializing code and use chaining.
Important: this() has to be the first line i ctr.

1. Consider static factory methods instead of constructors
	public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {
		return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
	}
This can be provided in addition to constructors. Advantages:
a. Can have well chosen names. A class can only have a single ctr()
   with given signature. Static methods can take same params but have
   different names - use well chosen names.
b. They are not required to create a new object each time they are invoked.
   Eg. Immutable classes can return preconstructed instances. The method
   above uses this technique.
c. Can return an object of any subtype of their return type. The returned
   objects need not be public. For instance, implementation classes can
   be hidden but returned - used to build interface-based frameworks.
   
Instance controlled classes:
Maintain strict control over what instances exist at any time.
Eg. Singleton, 
For Immutable classes, it makes guarantee that no two equal instances exist:
a.equals(b) if and only if a==b. Operator == is more efficient.

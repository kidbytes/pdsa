*** VECTOR
vector<int> first;                                // empty vector of ints
vector<int> second (4,100);                       // four ints with value 100
vector<int> third (second.begin(),second.end());  // iterating through second
vector<int> fourth (third);                       // a copy of third

// the iterator constructor can also be used to construct from arrays:
int myints[] = {16,2,77,29};
std::vector<int> fifth (myints, myints + sizeof(myints) / sizeof(int) );

* assign(): Replace current contents with new contents and update size accordingly. 
Automatic reallocation if required

first.assign (7,100);             // 7 ints with a value of 100
second.assign (first.begin(),first.end()-1); // the 5 central values of first

* at(i): Returns a ref at index i. Checks index bounds and throws out_of_range exception

* capacity(): >= size. Allocated storage capacity of the vector
Altered by reserve()

* clear(): Removes all elements leaving the container with a size of 0

* erase(pos): Erases item at position pos. Causes reallocation. Range version available too.

* front() / back(): Returns a ref to first/last element of the vector

* insert(pos, val) : Inserts val at pos. The current element appears after val

* void pop_back(): Removes the last element. Size is reduced by 1

* reserve(n): Increases the capacity to contain n elements. If the current capacity
is > n already then the call does nothing.

* resize(n): Resizes the vector to n. Can reallocate or truncate the vector i.e items
are inserted or erased. In the end size() returns n 

* swap(dest): swaps the current container with dest. Existing iterators, pointers and references
are valid and point to the same elements but in the other container.


*** LIST
* Implemented as doubly linked lists
* Constant insert and erase anywhere within the sequence and iteration in both directions.

* Lack direct access to the elements by their position. 

* assign(): Replace current contents with new contents and update size accordingly

* front() / back(): Returns a ref to first/last element

* clear(): Removes all elements leaving the container with a size of 0

* erase(pos): Removes single element at pos. Has range version too.

* insert(pos, val): Inserts new element at pos. Existing element appears after inserted element
Has range version too.

* merge(x): merges all elements in x at their respective positions.
This removes all elements in x. Elements are just transfered. Not ctr/dtr calls.

* void pop_back()/pop_front(): Removes last/first element

* void push_back()/push_front(): Add a new element at end/front

* remove(val): Removes all elements that compare equal to val. dtr is called

* remove_if (pred): Removes all elements for which pred returns true

* resize(): Same as vector. Resizes the container so that it contains n elements.
Possible truncation or reallocation.

* reverse(): Reverses the order of elements

* sort(cmp): Sorts the elements. If comp is missing uses operator <.
Comparison should produce a strict weak ordering of elements.

* splice(pos, x): Transfers elements from x into the container, inserting them at pos.
This alters the size of both containers.
splice(iterator pos, list& x, iterator i)
	-> transfers element at i from x and inserts at position pos
splice(iterator pos, list& x, iterator begin, iterator end)
    -> range version of above

* swap(x): Swaps container with x.

* unique(): If list is sorted, this method removes duplicates.


*** DEQUE
* Double ended queues are sequence containers that can expand/contract on both ends.

* Supports random access iterators

* There is no reserve() and capacity()

* Not guaranteed to store elements in contiguous storage locations. Can't use pointer arithmetic.
But can use random access iterators.

* front() / back()

* push_back() / push_front()

* pop_back() / pop_front()

* insert() / erase()

* swap()


*** SET
* set<int, classcomp> x; //Comparison class is classcomp with operator() overloaded

* Stores unique elements in a sorted order which may be different from the order in 
which elements were inserted. Typically implemented as BSTs.

* Once in the set they cannot be modified.

* pair<iterator, bool> insert(): Extends the container by inserting new element.
If the key already exists, item is not inserted and bool is set to false.

* clear(): Removes all elements, leaving the container with size 0.

* count(val): Returns count of elements that are equivalent to val

* find(val): Returns a iterator to val if found. Otherwise, return set::end()
Returns an iterator pointing to elements of type value_type. value_type is an alias
to type of items stored in set.

* lower_bound(val): Returns an iterator to first element >= val
If val is there, iterator to it is returned. Otherwise, iterator to next element is returned.

* upper_bound(val): Returns an iterator to the first element > val
1 1 2 3  - lower_bound(1) returns 0 index and upper_bound(1) return 2 index

* equal_range(val): Returns a [lower_bound, upper_bound) range for elements equivalent to val
Returns a pair of iterators

* erase(iter): Erases an element. Range version available too

* swap(x): Swaps this container wih x


*** MULTISET
* find(val): Returns an iterator to any of the matching val.
To get all matching elements, use equal_range()

* erase(): Will remove all matching elements

*** MAP
* Associative container. Sorted on keys

* at(key): Returns a reference to mapped value identified with key k.
If not available throws out_of_range exception

* find(key): Returns a iterator to key if found. Otherwise, return set::end()
Returns an iterator pointing to elements of type value_type. value_type is an alias
to pair<const key_type, mapped_type>

* clear(): Removes all elements, leaving the container with size 0.

* count(key): Returns number of occurences of key

* equal_range(): Same as set

* pair<iterator, bool> insert(): Extends the container by inserting new element.
If the key already exists, item is not inserted and bool is set to false.

* operator[](key): If key exists, function returns a reference to its mapped value.
Otherwise, it inserts a new element with that key and default value_type and returns a reference to it.

* swap(): Same as set



*** UNORDERED MAP
Uses hashing to store key -> value
The map has several buckets and each key hashes to a bucket.
The map can be considered to be an array of buckets.
A bucket is represented by an index in the map.
Several keys can hash to a single bucket as in regular hashing.
Constant complexity on average for retrieving keys. 
Faster than stl::map but not efficient for range based queries.

Container Properties:
Associative: Elements are accessed by keys and not by position
Unordered: Uses hash tables to fast access by key
Map: Key -> value association
Unique Keys: No two keys can be equivalent
Allocator-aware: Uses allocator obj to dynamically handle storage needs

Template Parameters:
Key: Type of key aliased as unordered_map::key_type
T:   Type of mapped value as unordered_map::mapped_type
Hash: Unary function object that hashes a key to return size_t 
      Default is hash<key>
	  Aliased as unordered_map::hasher
Pred: A binary predicate to determine if 2 keys are equivalent
      No two keys in the map should return true technically.

Iterator of this map points to an object of type pair<const Key, T> and this 
is aliased as unordered_map::value_type
it->first is the key
it->second is the value


Same methods as a stl:map with a few more.

* bucket_count(): Return the number of buckets
* bucket_size() : Number of keys that belong to this bucket.
* bucket()      : Given a key returns the bucket (index) to which it belongs.
* max_bucket_count(): System max. size_t type.

* load_factor():  numElements / numBuckets i.e numElements per bucket
                  Influences probability of collision. If the load factor
				  increases beyond a certain threshold, numBuckets is increased
				  

* max_load_factor(): Get/Set threshold of load_factor. If this threshold is reached,
                     rehashing is done. Default max_load_factor is 1 meaning
					 numBuckets == numElements. Remember each bucket may
					 contain more than one key. Even if all keys map to the
					 same bucket the load factor still can be 1. It is just that
					 other buckets are empty. 
					 Default load factor can be less than 1 - more buckets than keys.


* rehash(n): Sets the number of buckets to n or more. 
             A rehash is the reconstruction of the hash table. All keys are 
			 rearragned to new set of buckets. Rehashes are automatically
			 performed when max_load_factor is surpassed.
			 If n is lower than the current number of buckets it a no-op.
     
* reserve():

* hash_function(): Get hash function
* key_eq(): Get key equivalence predicate
                 
*** PRIORITY_QUEUE
* top():   Access top element
* push():  Insert element
* pop():   Remove top element

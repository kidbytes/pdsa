What is not part of STL?
* Container adapters (stack, queue, priority_queue) and containers bitset and 
valarray are not part of STL because they lack iterator support.

* Arrays are part of C++ language and not the library.

* Extensions of the standard C++ library like - hash containers, singly linked
lists and ropes.


Terms
* Std sequence containers: vector, string, deque, list
  Std associative containers: set, multiset, map, multimap
  
* Input Iterators:  read-only. Each location may be read only once
  Output Iterators: write-only. Each location may be written only once
  - Modelled on reading and writing streams. istream_iterators and
    ostream_iterators are common manifestations
    
  Forward Iterators: have the capabilities of both input and output iterators.
                     Plus they can read/write a single location repeatedly.
                     They can only move forward.
  
  Bidirectional:     Forward Iterators + move backward.                    
                     Assoc containers and lists have these iterartors.
                     
  Random Access Iterators: Random Iterators + Iterator arithmetic          
                           vector, string and deque provide these iterators.          
                           Pointers intro arrays act as random iterators
                           
* Any class that overloads operator() is a functor class. Objects of these
classes are known as function objects. Any place where a real function works,
a function object also works.
